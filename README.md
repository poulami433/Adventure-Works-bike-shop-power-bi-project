# OVERVIEW OF THE ADVENTURE WORKS BIKE SHOP POWER BI PROJECT :

The Power Bi Project is comprehensive analysis and visualization of the adventure works bike shop data . It's desighned as a practical application of the skills taught in the "Power Bi Desktop 2024" , course by @Maven Analytics  . Key features of this project include :

1. Interactive Dashboards : Customized dashboards providing insightful metrics and KPIs relevant metrics to the bike shop's operations
2. Data Models : Well-structured data models that integrate various data sources for a holistic view of the business.
3. Analytical Report : Detailed reports focusing on sales performance , customer demographics ,inventory management and more.
4. Visualizations : A range of visualization including bar charts , line graphs , pic charts ,and maps offering intuitive data interpretations .

  In this project I used Power Bi to visualize the sales and returns data of a hypothetical bike shop . Adventure Works . Using techniques learned throughout the course . I visualized global data across time periods ,products and customers . 

  I decided to use this project purely as a method to learn the visualization and amalysis techniques , choosing not to actually analyse the results in any real depth as the data is made up and didn’t seem to display any meaningful trends. I’m currently working on a much more interesting project which will have some much more exciting analysis! 

 # The Data

 This data comes from Maven Analytics and is hypothetical, as mentioned above. The data was stored in 3 separate tables, with 56,046 rows of sales data, 1,809 rows of returns data and 293 rows of product data. The raw data is provided as part of this course and so is only accessible as part of this course. 

 # Key Insights Techniques Learned 

 I started off by connecting and shaping the data, carrying out some data quality assurance and getting the tables in order. This was my first time working in the Power BI query editor so there was a lot of new content! Moving on, I created my first data model, learning about relational models, cardinality, and filter flow. This was one of the most interesting sections as these are concepts which I could’ve definitely overlooked had I self-studied Power BI! 
 Then came the section I was most looking forward to – learning DAX. This is the part I’ve heard people talk about, the power of BI’s DAX functionality is really impressive. 

 # Some of favourite tools and functions 

 1. Measures – the way that you can utilise measures in visualisations gives Power BI a big step up on Excel for me. 
 2. Switch – although I’ve since found out this is available in Excel too, this was the first time I’d seen this function and I love the simplicity of it. 
 3. Related – I’ve been using VLOOKUPs for a long time and, to be fair, their syntax is pretty logical, but this takes logical syntax to a whole new level. 
 After learning DAX came the exciting part of actually building some dashboards. I built 4 dashboards and a decomposition tree, which are pretty in depth and will naturally be better viewed in Power BI Service where the functionality all works, but I thought I’d include some screenshots to show my favourite features below.
